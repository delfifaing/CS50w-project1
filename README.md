#Project 1 for Harvard's CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

PAPYRIR is a web application generated using a flask framework. This project was part of Harvard's CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It allows users to create an account, login, review/rate any of the books saved in books.csv and view other user's review. Additionally, it uses the third party API by Goodreads, to pull ratings from their audience. Finally, any user will be able to query for book details programmatically via the website’s API. A PostgreSQL database was used, hosted by Heroku. As seen in import.py, 3 tables were generated: books, users and reviews. All the management and queries of the tables was done via raw SQL commands.
